# Graph-Cuts for F-Formation (GCFF)

by Francesco Setti, Chris Russell, Chiara Bassetti and Marco Cristani


### Introduction

> *An F-formation arises whenever two or more people sustain a spatial and orientational relationship in which the space between them is one to which they have equal, direct, and exclusive access.*
> [A. Kendon, 1990]

GCFF is a method to detect F-formations in static images, leveraging on the power of graph-cuts algorithms in clustering graphs.
In our formulation the nodes are represented by people in the scene and the candidate o-space centres, while edges are defined between each pair of nodes of different type (i.e. between a person and a candidate o-space centre).
We model the probability of each individual to belong to a specific o-space as a gaussian distribution.
We then build the cost function by adding a Minimum Description Length (MDL) prior and considering the log function of the probability obtained.
Moreover, we introduce an additive term which acts as the visibility constraint on the individual i regardless of the group person j is assigned to.

You can find more details about the method on the original PloS One [paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123783) or on the dedicated [webpage](http://vips.sci.univr.it/research/fformation/).

### Getting started

#### System requirements:
* MATLAB with a supported compiler

#### Installation:
1. Clone the GCFF repository:

    ```Shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/franzsetti/GCFF.git
    ```

    Lets call the directory you cloned `GCFF_ROOT`.

2. The repository already contains mex files for Windows and Linux 64bit machines. If you have a different system, you will need to mex the files again. To do that: open Matlab, move to the graphopt subfolder and run compile.m script.

    ```Matlab
    > cd GCFF_ROOT/graphopt
    > compile.m
    ```

3. Add the folder and subfolders to matlab path

    ```Matlab
    > addpath(genpath(GCFF_ROOT)) ;
    ```


### Using with python

#### Prerequisites:

- [octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) (make sure that both `octave` and `octave-cli` are in your path).
- [octave-statistics](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Statistics.html).
- [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html).

#### Get ready

- Compile octave dependencies with `./build.sh`.
- Install python and its dependencies with `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
- Activate the conda environment with `source activate GCFF`.

#### Using in code

See `gcff.py` for the two ways to use the python wrapper, to call the GCFF algorithm directly, or to track F-Formations over time.

#### Using as a web server

- Run the server with stride and mdl configured using command line arguments: `python server.py 1 100` (stride is 1, mdl is 100).
- Optionally, check that everything runs smoothly from another terminal:
```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: text/csv" --data "`cat features_example.csv`" http://localhost:5000/
```
- Build a client in whatever language you want!

##### Track F-Formations over time

If knowing the F-Formation of static images or frames is not enough for you, and you need to identify F-Formations over time, you can use the `/continuous` endpoing of the server. See the `gcff.ContinuousGC` for more information.


### Data

In order to run the example provided and to reproduce the experiments of the original paper, you may want to download the datasets [here](http://vips.sci.univr.it/research/fformation/download/data.zip).
The dataset can be downloaded with `python get_dataset.py`.

Each dataset folder contains 3 files:
- 'features.mat' -> all the detections are stored in the variable 'features'; features{t} is an Nx4 matrix that stores all the detections at frame 't', columns are [ ID, x, y, orientation ]
- 'groundtruth.mat' -> groups ground truths, timestamp variable is needed to match with the features.mat file.
- 'settings.mat' -> parameter settings for the experiments (see the code for more details). This file is just an example and it could be replicated for different versions of experiments. Please use your own settings file if you want to run other experiments.


### Contacts

For any problem by using this code or with the datasets, please send an email to <francesco.setti@univr.it> .
